We all make same mistakes, some of us overthink the problem and some of us just want to find the solution and make the test pass. When it comes to changing the code we are very easy pulled into pain driven development, and starting to look for a way out. I want to point out the real cost of change, and how it may seem that simple and clean code doesn't have real business value, legacy code have the technical debt that eventually need to be addressed, before declaring technical bankruptcy.
