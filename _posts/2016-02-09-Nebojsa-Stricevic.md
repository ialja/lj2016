When we start developing a new feature for Semaphore CI, we create a feature flag. This allows us to gradually develop the feature by pushing code to production early and often, while also keeping the feature hidden from our users. But, our features are supercharged â€” they also provide stats on how many users are using each feature and how much money every feature brings us. This is a story about how we learned some interesting facts about our system by pushing our practices further than before.
