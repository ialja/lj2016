Use your own words and your preferred language to write about how you could use Jekyll for your own projects and write any notes you’ve scribbled on paper during previous parts. You can use this as your learning journal. Don’t rush this part, feel free to take as much time as you need to sort through your thoughts and ask questions about parts that still confuse you.
