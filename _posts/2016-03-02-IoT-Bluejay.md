Bluejay is the worldâ€™s first smart mount that seamlessly connects your phone to your car. The device comes integrated with Bluetooth Smart beacon technology, which keeps you connected beyond the confines of your vehicle, and can also help you find your car in a crowded parking lot. Bluejay also comes with an app that reduces distractions while driving. Bluejay, a project by The Kiwi Factory, is currently raising funds on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1509130378/bluejay-the-worlds-first-smart-mount-for-your-car/).
