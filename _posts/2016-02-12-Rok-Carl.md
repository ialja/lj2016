It's hard to come into the operations sphere if you are a developer, but the category is on the rise and very promising for 2016, so some developers will transition to DevOps. This talk will help understand the shortcommings of devs vs. ops and how to focus on dev strengths to allow you to keep your title while businesses try to change it. We will do this by exploring where DevOps can bring value to the company, what some of the good career choices are and how to be useful from day 1.
