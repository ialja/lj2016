There's a lot of information (and hype) about scaling apps, distributing them on hundreds of servers, putting them in the cloud using some existing PaaS or making your own (good luck with that). But what if you don't have a site with millions of visits that would justify those things and just want to make sure your app is (almost) always available with as little effort and smallest possible change to your architecture and application code. We had the chance of doing the that and I will discuss how we did it and experiences we had.
